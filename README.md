The magnetotelluric (MT) method is a powerful geophysical technique that uses naturally occurring electromagnetic fields to investigate the Earthâ€™s subsurface electrical conductivity. This non-invasive method has found applications in various fields, such as mineral exploration, hydrocarbon prospecting, and tectonic studies.
